# Requirements
## Introduction
  My proposed application named **ShuttleScore** calculates the points of each of the players of the **shuttle badminton** game with respective to the point they secure. It also displays the name of the players, set points and points scored in each of the sets.
## Research
  In the previous method, they have already done the shuttle score board. Now I am trying on my own method to display the shuttle badminton score.
## Cost and Features and Timeline
  It is developed to bring a new visual to the score board in a better way.
## Defining our system
  Instead of using the same visual or the same format, we can see something new in appearance.
